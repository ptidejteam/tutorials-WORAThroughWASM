# tutorials-WORAThroughWASM

The history of computers shows a tension between the desire to have specialised, highly efficient hardware and to have the same software accessible no matter the hardware. This tension led to the idea of Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) popularised by Java in the nineties. Java's vision of WORA, principally built on Java Applets did not obtain the expected success (for several reasons discussed in this presentation). Recently, the idea of WORA reappeared thanks to the inception of WebAssembly, mostly by Mozilla. With WebAssembly, several complementary projects now allow developers to write their code once, and run it anywhere, with the Web browser as universal platform. These projects include Emscripten, TeaVM, CheerpJ, which are presented with examples and discussed for advantages and limitations.
